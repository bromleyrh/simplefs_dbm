FDATASYNC(3POSIX)                                    POSIX Programmer's Manual                                    FDATASYNC(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
       the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       fdatasync — synchronize the data of a file (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int fdatasync(int fildes);

DESCRIPTION
par.1  The fdatasync() function shall force all currently queued I/O operations associated with the file indicated by file descrip‐
       tor fildes to the synchronized I/O completion state.

    2  The functionality shall be equivalent to fsync() with the symbol _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO defined, with the exception that all
       I/O operations shall be completed as defined for synchronized I/O data integrity completion.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the fdatasync() function shall return the value 0; otherwise, the function shall return the value −1 and  set
       errno  to  indicate the error. If the fdatasync() function fails, outstanding I/O operations are not guaranteed to have been
       completed.

ERRORS
       The fdatasync() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.

       EINVAL This implementation does not support synchronized I/O for this file.

       In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail, fdatasync() shall return the error conditions  defined  for  read()
       and write().
