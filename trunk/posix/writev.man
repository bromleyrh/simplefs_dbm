WRITEV(3POSIX)                                       POSIX Programmer's Manual                                       WRITEV(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
       the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       writev — write a vector

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/uio.h>

       ssize_t writev(int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);

DESCRIPTION
       The writev() function shall be equivalent to write(), except as described below. The writev() function shall  gather  output
       data  from  the  iovcnt  buffers  specified by the members of the iov array: iov[0], iov[1], ..., iov[iovcnt−1].  The iovcnt
       argument is valid if greater than 0 and less than or equal to {IOV_MAX}, as defined in <limits.h>.

       Each iovec entry specifies the base address and length of an area in memory from which data should be written. The  writev()
       function shall always write a complete area before proceeding to the next.

       If  fildes  refers  to  a  regular  file and all of the iov_len members in the array pointed to by iov are 0, writev() shall
       return 0 and have no other effect. For other file types, the behavior is unspecified.

       If the sum of the iov_len values is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the operation shall fail and no data shall be transferred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, writev() shall return the number of bytes actually written. Otherwise, it shall return  a  value
       of −1, the file-pointer shall remain unchanged, and errno shall be set to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       Refer to write().

       In addition, the writev() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The sum of the iov_len values in the iov array would overflow an ssize_t.

       The writev() function may fail and set errno to:

       EINVAL The iovcnt argument was less than or equal to 0, or greater than {IOV_MAX}.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Writing Data from an Array
       The  following  example  writes  data from the buffers specified by members of the iov array to the file associated with the
       file descriptor fd.

           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <sys/uio.h>
           #include <unistd.h>
           ...
           ssize_t bytes_written;
           int fd;
           char *buf0 = "short string\n";
           char *buf1 = "This is a longer string\n";
           char *buf2 = "This is the longest string in this example\n";
           int iovcnt;
           struct iovec iov[3];

           iov[0].iov_base = buf0;
           iov[0].iov_len = strlen(buf0);
           iov[1].iov_base = buf1;
           iov[1].iov_len = strlen(buf1);
           iov[2].iov_base = buf2;
           iov[2].iov_len = strlen(buf2);
           ...
           iovcnt = sizeof(iov) / sizeof(struct iovec);

           bytes_written = writev(fd, iov, iovcnt);
           ...
