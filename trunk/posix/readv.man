READV(3POSIX)                                        POSIX Programmer's Manual                                        READV(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
       the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       readv — read a vector

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/uio.h>

       ssize_t readv(int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);

DESCRIPTION
par.1  The readv() function shall be equivalent to read(), except as described below. The readv() function shall  place  the  input
       data  into  the  iovcnt  buffers  specified by the members of the iov array: iov[0], iov[1], ..., iov[iovcnt−1].  The iovcnt
       argument is valid if greater than 0 and less than or equal to {IOV_MAX}.

    2  Each iovec entry specifies the base address and length of an area in memory where data should be placed. The  readv()  func‐
       tion shall always fill an area completely before proceeding to the next.

    3  Upon successful completion, readv() shall mark for update the last data access timestamp of the file.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to read().

ERRORS
       Refer to read().

       In addition, the readv() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The sum of the iov_len values in the iov array overflowed an ssize_t.

       The readv() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The iovcnt argument was less than or equal to 0, or greater than {IOV_MAX}.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Reading Data into an Array
       The  following example reads data from the file associated with the file descriptor fd into the buffers specified by members
       of the iov array.

           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <sys/uio.h>
           #include <unistd.h>
           ...
           ssize_t bytes_read;
           int fd;
           char buf0[20];
           char buf1[30];
           char buf2[40];
           int iovcnt;
           struct iovec iov[3];

           iov[0].iov_base = buf0;
           iov[0].iov_len = sizeof(buf0);
           iov[1].iov_base = buf1;
           iov[1].iov_len = sizeof(buf1);
           iov[2].iov_base = buf2;
           iov[2].iov_len = sizeof(buf2);
           ...
           iovcnt = sizeof(iov) / sizeof(struct iovec);

           bytes_read = readv(fd, iov, iovcnt);
           ...

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       Refer to read().

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
