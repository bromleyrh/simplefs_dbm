CLOSEDIR(3POSIX)                                     POSIX Programmer's Manual                                     CLOSEDIR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
       the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       closedir — close a directory stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dirent.h>

       int closedir(DIR *dirp);

DESCRIPTION
       The closedir() function shall close the directory stream referred to by the argument dirp.  Upon return, the value  of  dirp
       may  no longer point to an accessible object of the type DIR.  If a file descriptor is used to implement type DIR, that file
       descriptor shall be closed.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, closedir() shall return 0; otherwise, −1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The closedir() function may fail if:

       EBADF  The dirp argument does not refer to an open directory stream.

       EINTR  The closedir() function was interrupted by a signal.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Closing a Directory Stream
       The following program fragment demonstrates how the closedir() function is used.

           ...
               DIR *dir;
               struct dirent *dp;
           ...
               if ((dir = opendir (".")) == NULL) {
           ...
               }

               while ((dp = readdir (dir)) != NULL) {
           ...
               }

               closedir(dir);
           ...

APPLICATION USAGE
