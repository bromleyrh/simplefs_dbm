CREAT(3POSIX)                                        POSIX Programmer's Manual                                        CREAT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
       the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       creat — create a new file or rewrite an existing one

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/stat.h>
       #include <fcntl.h>

       int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode);

DESCRIPTION
par.1  The creat() function shall behave as if it is implemented as follows:

           int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode)
           {
               return open(path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, mode);
           }

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to open().

ERRORS
       Refer to open().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Creating a File
       The following example creates the file /tmp/file with read and write permissions for the file owner and read permission  for
       group and others. The resulting file descriptor is assigned to the fd variable.

           #include <fcntl.h>
           ...
           int fd;
           mode_t mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH;
           char *pathname = "/tmp/file";
           ...
           fd = creat(pathname, mode);
           ...

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The creat() function is redundant. Its services are also provided by the open() function. It has been included primarily for
       historical purposes since many existing applications depend on it. It is best considered a part of the C binding rather than
       a function that should be provided in other languages.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
