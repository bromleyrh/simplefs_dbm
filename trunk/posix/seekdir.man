SEEKDIR(3POSIX)                                      POSIX Programmer's Manual                                      SEEKDIR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
       the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       seekdir — set the position of a directory stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dirent.h>

       void seekdir(DIR *dirp, long loc);

DESCRIPTION
       The seekdir() function shall set the position of the next readdir() operation on the directory stream specified by  dirp  to
       the  position specified by loc.  The value of loc should have been returned from an earlier call to telldir() using the same
       directory stream. The new position reverts to the one associated with the directory stream when telldir() was performed.

       If the value of loc was not obtained from an earlier call to telldir(), or if a call to  rewinddir()  occurred  between  the
       call to telldir() and the call to seekdir(), the results of subsequent calls to readdir() are unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       The seekdir() function shall not return a value.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The  original standard developers perceived that there were restrictions on the use of the seekdir() and telldir() functions
       related to implementation details, and for that reason these functions need not be supported on  all  POSIX-conforming  sys‐
       tems. They are required on implementations supporting the XSI option.

       One  of  the  perceived  problems  of implementation is that returning to a given point in a directory is quite difficult to
       describe formally, in spite of its intuitive appeal, when systems that use B-trees,  hashing  functions,  or  other  similar
       mechanisms  to  order  their directories are considered. The definition of seekdir() and telldir() does not specify whether,
       when using these interfaces, a given directory entry will be seen at all, or more than once.

       On systems not supporting these functions, their capability can sometimes be accomplished by  saving  a  filename  found  by
       readdir() and later using rewinddir() and a loop on readdir() to relocate the position from which the filename was saved.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
